# Padre Gino's Pizza - a React challenge

This is my code along practice for the [Complete Intro to React, v9](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v9/) course on Frontend Masters.

Some performance elements like SSR are added after being through with [Intermediate React,v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v5/)

With minor changes and add-ons I humbly dared to accomplish.

- __Frontend deployed__ - via GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions (see the workflow in deploy.yml)

The app can be found here [Padre-Gino's Pizza](https://mykola-ci.github.io/padre-ginos-project/)

NOTE! The app is deployed in free tier on Render. Due to their free tier policies they put service asleep after a few minutes so it becomes dormant. Therefore please wait for as long as a minute or so until the app fetches our Pizza Of The Day for you! 

- __Backend deployed__ - via [RENDER](https://render.com/) .

- __Technologies used__:
  - React obviously (beginner to intermediary level)
  - Vite - as a frontend development server
  - Tanstack router & devtools
  - Fastify - as a backend server
  - SQLite - the simplest db solution (no need for complex database schemas in this case study) 


## Disclaimer
This is not a comprehensive e-commerce platform. It is just a collection of fragmented basic functionalities pertinent to e-commerce. The goal was to master basics of React. The backend is simplified to a limited number of API calls coming from the frontend, the database being SQLite with no authentication assumed. This app is just an evidence that being a Django loyalist I tried my best to get to know what was all that fuss about React
