## Padre Gino's Pizza - a React challenge

This is my code along practice for the [Complete Intro to React, v9](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v9/) course on Frontend Masters.

With minor changes and add-ons I humbly dared to accomplish.

- __Frontend deployed__ - via GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions (see the workflow in deploy.yml)

- __Backend deployed__ - via [RENDER](https://render.com/) 

- __Technologies used__:
  - React obviously (beginner to intermediary level)
  - Vite - as a frontend development server
  - Tanstack router & devtools
  - Fastify - as a backend server
  - SQLite - the simplest db solution (no need for complex database schemas in this case study)
